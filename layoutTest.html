                        Hey George, buddy, hey. I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.
                        Doc. I, I don't know. Good morning, Mom. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Hey kid,
                        what you do, jump ship? Uncle Joey didn't ship? Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

                    There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem 
                    with the Earth's gravitational pull? We never would have fallen in love. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going 
                    camping with the guys.
